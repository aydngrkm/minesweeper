# Minesweeper with AI

Welcome to Minesweeper with AI! This is a classic Minesweeper game with an added feature: an AI assistant to help you make guesses when you're stuck.

## How to Play

**Objective:** Clear the minefield without detonating any mines.

**Gameplay:** Click on a square to reveal what's underneath. If it's a mine, you lose. If it's empty, you'll see a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square. Use this information to deduce the location of mines.

**Marking Mines:** If you suspect a square contains a mine, right-click on it to flag it.

**Winning:** Clear all non-mine squares to win the game!
